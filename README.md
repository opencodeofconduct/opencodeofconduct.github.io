# Open Code of Conduct

An easy to reuse open source code of conduct **template** for communities.

Developed by the [@TODOGroup](https://twitter.com/todogroup) to promote code of conducts for open source communities. By participating in this project, you are expected to honor this [code of conduct](http://todogroup.org/opencodeofconduct/#Open+Code+of+Conduct/abuse@todogroup.org).

## FAQ

#### Why a code of conduct?

We strongly believe that a code of conduct helps set the ground rules for participation in communities, and more importantly helps to build a culture of respect and improve diversity. According to the latest [FLOSS survey](http://floss2013.libresoft.es/results.en.html), we have lots of work to do in improving diversity across open source communities.

Diversity is the spice of life. Having a diverse contributor community from different backgrounds and organizations will help set your community up for long term success. [Research](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-diversity-makes-us-smarter/) shows that diverse communities are more creative, diligent and innovative.

#### How is this code of conduct licensed?

A very liberal [CC-BY-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

#### What do you mean that the open code of conduct is a template?

It's very hard to develop a one size fits all code of conduct for open source communities, so we took template approach inspired by the [BSD license](http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause). This allows organizations to work off the core code of conduct while customizing it to their needs.

#### Can I use something simpler? What about the Contributor Covenant?

The [contributor convenant](http://www.ashedryden.com/blog/codes-of-conduct-101-faq) is a great option and we recommend you take a look at it. However, we had a need to make a customizable by default code of conduct in template form, geared towards organizations who run larger open source projects.
